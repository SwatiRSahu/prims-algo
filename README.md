# Prim’s Algorithm

Prim’s Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every node, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree are minimized. It is very simple yet very complicated to solve algorithm.
